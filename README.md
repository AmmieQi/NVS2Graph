## Dataset: ASL-DVS 
We source one of the largest neuromorphic vision dataset acquired under real-world conditions, and make it available to the research community at the link: 

ASL-DVS contains 24 classes correspond to 24 letters (A-Y, excluding J) from the American Sign Language (ASL). The ASL-DVS was recorded with an iniLabs DAVIS240c NVS camera set up in an office environment with low environmental noise and constant illumination.
